    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions. </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Mise en place. Pre-heat oven to 350°. Brown beef and Italian sausage in a large pan. Drain of fat. With the Italian sausage, I usually press on it with a paper towel too.</li>
        <li>Add spaghetti sauce to pan. Add spices to pan. Stir well, and set on a very low simmer.</li>
        <li>Boil a large pot of water. Sprinkle in a little salt and a dash of olive oil. Drop lasagna into boiling water. Cook until not quite done. (It will cook more in the oven and stiffer pasta is easier to work with). Lay out pasta on large towel</li>
        <li>Spray a large 9” x 13” pan with non-stick spray. (or grease very lightly)</li>
        <li>Set up lasagna making station:

            <li>cottage cheese</li>
            <li>mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>parmesan cheese</li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Cover bottom of pan with thin layer of sauce/meat.</li>
        <li>Cover with one layer of noodles. Smear sauce on top of the noodles. Spread 1/2 of cottage cheese. Sprinkle 1/3 of mozzarella and 1/3 of Parmesan over this.</li>
        <li>Cover with one layer of noodles. Smear sauce on top of the noodles. Spread 1/2 of cottage cheese. Sprinkle 1/3 of mozzarella and 1/3 of Parmesan over this</li>
